# Olympic Athletes Classification

This repository contains a jupyter notebook file with an analysis and predictive model of Olympic Athletes from the years 1980 to 2016. To access the Jupyter Notebook, simply click on the "Olympic Athletes Analysis and Classification Model" in the main. The dataset is from Kaggle and was originally collected from www.sports-reference.com by Randi Griffin.

## Tools

The analysis and predictive models were completed in python and using the pycaret package.  Pycaret is a low-code package used for machine learning and forecasting.  Their time series modeling just arrived in their latest update and had some issues installing.  To get around that I created a virtual environment and used that kernel for the notebook.  

## Inspiration

This dataset provided me an opportunity to work on creating classification models with data I'm passionate about. As an avid olympic fan, I thought it would be fun to come up with a way to predict the sport category of an athlete based on some of their features. I also wanted to get more practice with pycaret for different model types.
